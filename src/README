All files in here could use a full audit.

From previous maintainer:
Some things missing from this version -- especially fridge work and items
that were temp. deprecated (like the mech code).

## HOW TO INSTALL ##
First, edit localconfig.h and change logging settings to your preference.
Next, make the necessary changes in comm.c to add yourself to the
list of administrators (search for 'imp_table' and scroll down).

Requirements:
gcc, make, libcares, and a standard set of libraries (case Cnetos 6 install).

You'll need to perform the following steps:
1. Build and install libcares (https://c-ares.haxx.se) for DNS resolution.
2. Build the server by typing 'make'
3. Run the server by executing './ground0' (that's a zero not the letter O)

## IT DOESN'T WORK ##
1. Make sure your LD path is correct if getting shared library errors:
1a. run 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/lib'
1b. run 'export $LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
