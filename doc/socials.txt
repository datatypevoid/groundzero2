Social table format:
The social table is defined in social-edit.c; the socials themselves are 
loaded at boot time in db.c which calls load_social_table() in 
social-edit.c.  This function reads boot/social.txt, the first line of 
which is an integer which defines maxSocial, itself used to allocate memory 
for the social table.  load_social_table() simply reads through 
boot/social.txt line-by-line and loads socials in order; there is no error 
checking.

An individul social is defined as follows; all lines must end in '~':
name~            (the name (command) of the social)
char_no_arg~     (what the character executing the social sees if using
others_no_arg~   no argument)
char_found~      (if the target (argument) exists, what is seen)
others_found~    (what others see if the target exists)
vict_found~	 (what the victim sees)
char_auto~       (what the character sees if victim not found)
others_auto~     (what others see if victim not found)
